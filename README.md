# Switchboard 

A very simple switchboard for little kids made from scrap parts for xmas. Contains a DFPlayer mini with a speaker, a vibration motor, and a Neopixel LED as outputs. Each is connected to a banana connector wire that can be plugged in into a 3x3 switchboard. Depending on where it's plugged, different stuff happens. Furthermore, consists of 2 switches and 2 USB-A sockets for adding usb-powered peripherals and an internal power bank. Uses ATmega324p at its heart. 

# TODO 

- get & test a power bank
